SoundSync
=========

###This allows a user to enter in the username of a Soundcloud user and download either all of their tracks or just the tracks they have liked.

#####You must go to http://soundcloud.com/you/apps/ and register a new application. Once that is done you need to grab the ClientID of that application and paste it into the application where the "api" variable is.
#####Once that is complete the application should be functional.


##This application is based on the source code that is found here - http://distortednetworks.com/proj/ courtesy of Distortednet.
